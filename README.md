# Leveraging SQL for Financial Analysis

### Introduction
In today's data-driven business environment, organizations rely on robust financial reporting to gain insights into their financial performance, make informed decisions, and communicate effectively with stakeholders.Financial reporting involves the compilation, analysis, and presentation of financial data in a structured format to facilitate decision-making.It involves extracting raw financial data from various sources such as transactional databases, ERP systems, or spreadsheets.
In the Process of transforming raw data onto Financial Reporting I have used the following tables:
  
     1.GL- General Ledgers table Contains detailed transactional data, including account IDs, transaction dates, amounts, and descriptions.
     2.COA- Chart of Accounts table conatins information about financial accounts grouped into categories, such as assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses, and used for recording transactions in the organization's general ledger.
     3.Calendar - Contains Dates related to transaction
     4.Territory- Stores data related to geographic territories

 The 3 statements i.e The Profit and Loss Statement,
 The Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement  is the foundation of corporate accounting. Data found in all these is used to calculate important financial ratios that provide insight on the companyâ€™s financial performance and potential issues that may need to be addressed.
